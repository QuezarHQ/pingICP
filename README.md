# pingICP


## Application Overview

Ping is a notification service that boosts ecosystem engagement by creating a direct communication channel between dapp developers and their respective users.

Ping caters to two user personas, dapp developers & dapp users. User stories for each user persona are listed below:

A dapp developer can:
- login/authenticate on the platform => to verify themselves
- create a publisher profile => to make themselves discoverable by subscribers (dapp users)
- post an update => to keep their subscribers informed about important events
- view update history => to see the updates they sent previously

A dapp user can:
- login/authenticate on the platform => to access their inbox
- view list of publishers (dapps) => to select the dapps that are relevant to them. 
- subscribe to a publisher => to receive updates from it
- view their inbox => to see updates from all dapps they have subscribed to

Do check it out the live version deployed [here](https://h7jna-pqaaa-aaaak-afgiq-cai.icp0.io/)! You'll need to have a wallet supporting the ICP network, (eg BitFinity) to connect to the application.


### NOTE

The application is in prototype stage. Further enhancements coming soon...
